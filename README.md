# Inside the Swipe: Tracking and Profiling Credit Card Fraud

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to detect and analyze credit card fraud patterns.  
Using behavioral analytics, machine learning techniques, and explainable AI models, it provides insights into when, where, and how fraudulent transactions occur.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Transaction Behavior Analysis**:  
  Explore how legitimate and fraudulent transactions vary by hour and amount size.
  
- **Fraud Pattern Discovery**:  
  Compare fraud vs non-fraud transaction behaviors and uncover timing patterns.

- **Feature Importance and Explainability**:  
  Identify the most influential features using Random Forest and SHAP explainability.

- **Outlier and Anomaly Detection**:  
  Spot unusual transaction behavior with Isolation Forest unsupervised learning.

- **Risk Profiling and Strategy**:  
  Visualize high-risk periods and transaction amounts using fraud rate heatmaps.

- **Forecasting Future Fraud Volume**:  
  Predict expected fraud activity using Facebook Prophet time-series forecasting.

- **Data Export**:  
  Download filtered datasets for further exploration or Tableau integration.

- **Professional Dashboard Touches**:  
  Includes welcome instructions, strategic summaries, risk commentary, acknowledgments, and a custom footer.
